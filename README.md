## 🧠 About Me

I'm a Senior Backend Developer with a decade of experience designing, building, and scaling robust backend systems. My expertise spans a wide range of programming languages and frameworks, and I specialize in architecting secure, high-performance, and maintainable systems.

From RESTful APIs to real-time microservices, from relational databases to NoSQL storage, and from monoliths to distributed architectures - I build software that’s engineered for growth, observability, and resilience.
